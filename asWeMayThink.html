    <p style = "color: #ddded1"> &emsp; Vannevar Bush had a great understanding of a human's dependence on technology in 1945. His speculative essay follows human manipulation of science to its benefit, first for the use of the material world around us, the understanding of biology, healthcare, communication, and warfare. Bush proposes a future in which we develop technology to make us smarter, whether it is to our benefit or our detriment. The ways of making a human smarter, Bush understands, is through alleviating pains of documentation and memory. This is the greatest way to develop more advanced technologies. His speculations for future technologies are for the most part, realized in today's machines and devices. A computer can do calculus, a photo can be sent over great distances, and a person uses a personal computer to organize files, suggesting different programs and systems for what it thinks we each need differently from the next.

    <p style = "color: #ddded1"> &emsp; Bush came out of a time of great political and social discomfort in wartime. His hope for technology was limited to skeptical optimism. Bush recognizes the harmful effects of science creating new ways to destroy each other, yet does not suggest ways in which developing technology can do harm. Rather, he speaks of each idea as a way to expand the limits of human memory and intelligence. One exciting technology he speaks of is a “memex” which suggests new information by ways of association, rather than indexing. This technology is common now, in search suggestions, recommended videos, and even by similar images. What Bush fails to see in 1945 is the addictive nature of humans and how susceptible we are to a cycle. One of the more notable problems with an endless string of “you might like this too!” suggestions is of children existing on the internet and the undeveloped critical mind. Of course, this is a difficult thing to predict of a technology which does not yet exist, yet Bush seems to hope that the development of more powerful personal machines will only create a more intelligent society of people.

    <p style = "color: #ddded1"> &emsp; It’s important to note that Bush knows that with more access to information, a person's intelligence increases. Yet it’s not because of a personal collection of recorded information that makes having personal computers significant, it’s our access to public information being shared over the internet. A community of everyone existing on the internet contributes to the sharing of information. A community is what makes living in the age of the internet feel so strange and meaningful.
